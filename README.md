# PASSMAN 

this for now is a locally ran password manager, idk if ill make a gui or not
probably i will.

spike folder is the python demo version so right now im trying to get that done within a day

then if i decide to keep it local i will write it in either c, c#, or java

if i try to do cross platform idk what im gonna do whether i use php, js or something else like java
